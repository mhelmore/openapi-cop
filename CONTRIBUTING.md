# Contributing guidelines

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible.

## Any change starts with a pull request

Pull requests are _the_ way to propose changes to the codebase (we
use [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)). We actively welcome your pull
requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Report bugs using GitHub issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/EXXETA/openapi-cop/issues/new) â€” it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, context and sample code

Here's [a great example from Craig Hockenberry](http://www.openradar.me/11905408).

_Great Bug Reports_ tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background context
- Steps to reproduce
    - Be specific!
    - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a consistent coding style

Try hard to be consistent with existing code.

The repo includes an .editorconfig file that most IDEs nowadays take into account when (auto-)formatting. You can
do `npm run check` to check you conform to the defined lint rules.
