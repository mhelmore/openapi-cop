 * Utility script for spawning a openapi-cop instance and a mock server in parallel

 * node ./spawn [openapi-path]
 *
 *     openapi-path (optional): path to the OpenAPI file on which both the proxy server
 *             and the mock server will be based on. If the file path is relative, it is relative to the project base.
 *             Defaults to a hard-coded file (see below).
 *
 * This script is called/aliased by `npm run dev-start-along-mock`.
